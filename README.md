A few QOL Cider changes, intended to enhance other themes, but may also be used by itself<br>

<br>
Change #1: Changed the font to Inter<br>
Change #2: Fixed the bug where song info with a marquee breaks the line spacing<br>
Change #3: Made the song title / album+artist fade consistent regardless of window size, and generally made it nicer looking<br>
Change #4: Fixed the fade misrepresenting the actual size to the marquee logic (i.e. there was a sweet spot where resizing the window covered some of the text with the fade without marquee'ing)<br>
Change #5: Changed the positioning of the fade based on whether or not the CAP / spatializiation icon is present<br>
Change #6: Removed max width on the song info<br>
Change #7: Keep playback controls on bottom (in case another theme tries to move it) and readjust vertically<br>
Change #8: Reposition song duration text vertically (goes in hand with #7)<br>
Change #9: Brighten the background<br>
Change #10: Prevent other themes from dulling the background<br>
Change #11: Prevent other themes from changing the window controls style<br>
<br>
